## Contribution To Tyler Vitelli's Discord
---

On September 24, 2024 (**this date is inaccurate due to rejoining**) Shade joined the Tyler Vitelli Discord as a [gretcher](/gretcher), he made a slow rise onto admin along with Aaron (another Co-Owner of Tyler Vitelli's Discord). His early contributions were noticeable and kept him next in line for ownership of the server along with [spring](/spring). After the *Lucas Incident* he had brought the Sapphire Bot to the Discord Server & since then,the server's core infrastrucutre, auto-moderation, staff management & anti-nuking is based on the Sapphire Bot. 

### Lucas Incident

Before his demotion on September 22, 2024 Lucas was an Owner/Admin in the Tyler Vitelli Discord Server. Though he had contributed a lot to the server such as bringing the Mimu Bot (which is still used to this day in the server) he was later caught due to drama & allegations against spring. Spring had also made a [Youtube Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/iuBOu064iXY) covering the proof to all the allegations, finalising Lucas' demise.

According to Spring & Shade's sources he had also agreed to "smash" a 9 year old (in his defense it was a fictional character, but she was only 9) which made him a pedophille. 

Lucas had also been reported to be sending eerie & creepy messages to members of the server. Here is a quote from a member to demonstrate:
> He’s been messaging me every night, being nice and shit but I’ve always gotten groomer vibes from him, like when he would repeatedly ask for me to send him a pic of myself and say what city I lived in

Due to this incident Shade & Aaron had been **promoted** to Co-Owners to the server, __this promotion would lead to his later rise in the server__

### Zydro Incident

After solidifying his position as an excellent administrator & owner in the server, with some even condering him "better than spring" as he had laid the complete setup to the server & with the help of TutlaMC, Spring & Soldier (a Head Moderator of the server at the time, banned later for controversies) develop a custom bot for the server (this was cancelled due to spring replacing fast python code with a bot builder. Later brought back to life as `my coolest bot`). Around the same time ZydroHub, the server's community manager spread fake allegations against shade and in swift action locked the server to take control, as a *coup d'état.* 

Zydro's reasons on "retiring":
![zydro](/content/shade/zydro_1.png)

Zydro's reasoning and allegations against shade were:

- **He was a female**: Zydro claimed Shade was a female, though when questioned about it he fell back to "a member told me that". Shade was not a female, and Zydro knew this himself. At the beggining of the message he refers to shade as "she", "her" but later on in the very same message uses "he". Shade had also sent a picture showing his face, which was the first time his face appeared on the internet. This allegation had no proof and was invalidated.

- **Shade's Dictatorship**: According to Zydro, Shade had assumed full control of the server and was acting as its "ultimate leader." While there was some truth to this claim, Shade's leadership was not that of a dictator, his efforts came from genuine dedication and wholehearted contribution. Still, many members felt he had taken on a far greater role in the server’s direction, with some even considering him "better than Spring."
- **Spring's inability to control shade**: 
- **Shade's usage of the N-Word**: Zydro also claimed shade had used the N-Word in his DMs several times and had proof but at the same time fake message methods were circulating around the server. Nevertheless shade had admitted of his usage on the word


With this uprising Zydro had many in his side including prominent members such as Fort & Hamza. General chat was locked and the community manager thought he had taken shade down, but with the support of many members and spring & shade he was banned. Shade then responded with a 1500 word response covering his, spring and Aaron's defense:

> The end.

> Zydro, you tried exposing me. It's time for your demise. It's debunking time.

> 1: Supposed Abuse:  What he claims is the mental abuse of multiple staff which is incorrect in tons of ways, i have implemented a bunch of help recourses for staff to enjoy and to make the moderation team not have a high set criteria, instead a bot can do the job of censoring the bad stuff that gets caught by the auto mod and give them the set punishment aswell. What he specifies here is the abuse in DMs where the normal members don't see, i have already told him a few times that i have a genetic problem, the genetic problem might sound like a crazy excuse but it's real, ongoing thing in my family with anger issues but i'm trying my best to overcome it, factor in that i am at the young age of 14 where my brain is not developed yet, i am aware that i did some bad stuff but Zydro overexaggurates what i do to higher extents which is annoying and that's just spreading total lies, for some reason he also wanted to include that i am a female, i am a male as i have said multiple times and proved by face revealing because of this guy's claims and done a bunch of voice messages.

> 2: Response Time:  I have not taken over a full day to respond to any of my staff members in a serious or a non-serious situation unless i have told people that i am on break, what he's referring to is me supposedly leaving him on read but i already explained to him what i meant by that, he was sick at the time and i did not reply due to me wanting him to rest. Also mentioning springs low response time but due to him having the pedostool and being pushed to the top of the screen as an owner of the server, he is a prime target for trolls that are trying to fuck around and find out. We higher staff members are put through a lot of stuff which require a ton of time and effort to proceed with, i want breaks from this server as i have reached a stupidly high 3,000 actions in the audit log and not including sapphire.

> 3: Corruption (Demotion): I have seen him and some others claim the corruption of my staff demotions but this is how it works, the more problems the one makes the bigger chance of them getting demoted, more problems than good is a demotion. If they make little problems but are a still good add-on to the staff team in general then they just get a staff warn and thats what they exist for, in hindsight it might seem stupid because of maybe a set ratio being there but there isn't, it depends on the severity of the problems and what they are even doing for the staff team in the first place, what he claims is that i was protecting uzi but the thing is i wanted to see what kind of reports were made on here but i got no response for it, what i got is "they made a lot of reports" after that i had to dig a little bit and found the disciminiatory content that lead to her demotion, a little patience and evidence is needed before firing Zydro. Uzi did a lot of good but the bad outweighed it after i found out what they did in the first place.

> 4: Power Hogging: There might have been some signs of the power hogging but they aren't that severe nor are they in that bad zone either, what i did was do what he was supposed to do while he was offline or told him to take a break because he was working hard compared to others back then. I don't really get what he was trying to say here but what i think is that he means that i don't let him make changes, i have done some extensive digging and he got someone else to make his server for him that he handles today , frequently asking for administrator isnt really anything you can escape with either man, people wanted you promoted as well but i do my research and i know who i am taking in to the staff team. A claim of me being this dictator of the server in itself is just a bad claim, if i had been corrupt i would have seen more warnings by spring but he got no complaints about me att all. I am trying to prioritize staff members well-being.

> 5: Admin+ claims: About spring, the owner of the server. Supposedly he's pocketing all the money for himself and not caring about the server, spring cares about this server a lot like me and built the base of this server, been managing it since the dawn of the server and helping out tyler aswell in the process, he might not be online that much in chat but it's because he has a life like all of you members, he has school like us. All of the staff members are under the age of 18 including me, i'm 14, aaron is 14, spring is 15, we aren't far apart. For Aaron he said that he does aboslutely nothing for the server, that isn't true. He comes in when i am sleeping, when i can't be online at after midnight, due to the timezone optimizarion of both the administrators in the server we can hold a 24 hour cycle, it might seem like aaron is not doing much in hindsight but he's doing more in the back of the server helping me out as a good administrator, he also helped defeat lucas the old predator we had as a CO-Owner, we have to give him something for that and he deserves admin because he knows how to handle hard situations like this. And I have been called out for being a bad administrator overall not coming up with great ideas and supposedly ruining the server, if that was the case i would have taken the constructive critisim that was thrown at me in DMs or in the suggestions tab and actually changed the server in the members favour because this server is all about the community and you guys are the most important part here, for you guys to feel like this is a great space to make friends in and an awesome place overall.

> 6: Aaron's homophobia: We are aware the homophobia itself is bad, Aaron has changed from his old ways. People can change, we told him to stop making homophobic remarks and he has tried to stop since, his minor homophobia with no bad intent does not outweigh the high amounts of work he has done to the server, (CLEARANCE: NOT SAYING HOMOPHOBIA IS GOOD).

> 7: Claiming High Accomplishments: He has said after this message that he has done more than me but that is easily debunkable by how long he has been in the staff team which was barely anything and also me working for an average of 5-8 hours a day for 45 days straight. He says that we have not treated him well enough for the amount of work he has done but i don't think so. I have screamed in his DMs which i am definetly sorry for but the intent was not bad, as i claimed earlier in this massive post that i have an issue that no one wants to believe. I have problems with temper but i am seriously trying to fix it, then he starts comparing me to Lucas which i swore to never copy and i took him down for a reason with aaron. I am taking responsibility for saying the N word multiple times though thou i am sorry, still in a young age and being influenced by others is a real thing. Again, i am 14. Not trying to play the victim card, it is definetly my fault for saying it but i did not say it in any racial manner at all regarding how he looks like or where he comes from as he even listed in the screenshots of his evidence of saying the N word. Screaming in his DMs with caps went a bit overboard aswell, i can agree but Soldier went to zydros DMs in a sarcastic way saying in quotations "I'm scared", he confirmed himself that it was satire and zydro went too far with what he did.
