## Early Life

His early life is relatively unknown. He was born and raised up in a Palestinian family living in Sweden as a Muslim, also known to have a sister (younger than him according to unknown sources). 

## Contribution To Tyler Vitelli's Discord
---

On September 24, 2024 (**this date is inaccurate due to rejoining**) Shade joined the Tyler Vitelli Discord as a [gretcher](/gretcher), he made a slow rise onto admin along with Aaron (another Co-Owner of Tyler Vitelli's Discord). His early contributions were noticeable and kept him next in line for ownership of the server along with [spring](/spring). After the *Lucas Incident* he had brought the Sapphire Bot to the Discord Server & since then,the server's core infrastrucutre, auto-moderation, staff management & anti-nuking is based on the Sapphire Bot. 

### Lucas Incident

Before his demotion on September 22, 2024 Lucas was an Owner/Admin in the Tyler Vitelli Discord Server. Though he had contributed a lot to the server such as bringing the Mimu Bot (which is still used to this day in the server) he was later caught due to drama & allegations against spring. Spring had also made a [Youtube Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/iuBOu064iXY) covering the proof to all the allegations, finalising Lucas' demise.

According to Spring & Shade's sources he had also agreed to "smash" a 9 year old (in his defense it was a fictional character, but she was only 9) which made him a pedophille. 

Lucas had also been reported to be sending eerie & creepy messages to members of the server. Here is a quote from a member to demonstrate:
> He’s been messaging me every night, being nice and shit but I’ve always gotten groomer vibes from him, like when he would repeatedly ask for me to send him a pic of myself and say what city I lived in

Due to this incident Shade & Aaron had been **promoted** to Co-Owners to the server, __this promotion would lead to his later rise in the server__

### Zydro Incident

Even after solidifying his position as an excellent administrator & owner in the server, with some even condering him "better than spring" as he had laid the complete setup to the server & with the help of TutlaMC, Spring & Soldier (a Head Moderator of the server at the time, banned later for controversies) develop a custom bot for the server (this was cancelled due to spring replacing fast python code with a slow ineffecient bot builder called BDFD, later brought back to life as `my coolest bot`)

## Contribution to Tutla Studios
---

Shade is responsible for the creation of Tusk & Tusan. Thanks to shade, Tutla Studios has managed to market Tusan & brought it's use to Tyler Vitelli's Discord in 2025 which led to the development of Tusan leading to the development of [Tums](/tums) & the [Tutla Wiki](/tutla_wiki) for documenting it & during his time period the development of Tutla Accounts. He was later promoted to Co Owner on 5th of August, 2025.
