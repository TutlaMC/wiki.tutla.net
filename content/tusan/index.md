## What is Tusan?

Tusan is a library made for creating interpreters & compilers (coming soon). Available in both Python, Java and soon Javascript. Used in [Tusk](https://tusk.tutla.net) & [Tums](/tums).

It comes with a custom prebuilt syntax with built in variable definition, function declaration and iterative statements.
